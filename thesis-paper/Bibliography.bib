    abstract={Environmental monitoring with mobile robots requires solving the informative path planning problem. A key challenge is how to compute a continuous path over space and time that will allow a robot to best sample the environment for an initially unknown phenomenon. To address this problem we devise a layered Bayesian Optimisation approach that uses two Gaussian Processes, one to model the phenomenon and the other to model the quality of selected paths. By using different acquisition functions over both models we tackle the exploration-exploitation trade off in a principled manner. Our method optimises sampling over continuous paths and allows us to find trajectories that maximise the reward over the path. We test our method on a large scale experiment for modelling ozone concentration in the US, and on a mobile robot modelling the changes in luminosity. Comparisons are presented against information based criteria and point-based strategies demonstrating the benefits of our method.},

This is particularly evident when the datasets have been collected for a particular purpose, e.g. scientific inquiry, or by autonomous agents in novel and inaccessible environments. In these situations there is scope for the use of unsupervised approaches that can model collections of images and automatically summarise their content. To this end, we present novel hierarchical Bayesian models for image clustering, image segment clustering, and unsupervised scene understanding. The purpose of this investigation is to highlight and compare hierarchical structures for modelling context within images based on visual data alone. We also compare the unsupervised models with state-of-the-art supervised and weakly supervised models for image understanding. We show that some of the unsupervised models are competitive with the supervised and weakly supervised models on standard datasets. Finally, we demonstrate these unsupervised models working on a large dataset containing more than one hundred thousand images of the sea floor collected by a robot. "}

Approximations are presented to assign upper and lower bounds to the information expected from the candidate missions.

We performed a multi-scale characterization of seafloor topography of the MAR. In the basin-scale analysis, we have used the 30″ General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) grid to estimate the area of different components of lower bathyal habitat in the main North Atlantic basin and to produce a corresponding depth–area relationship. The regional-scale investigation is based on swath bathymetry surveys which show the flanks to \{MAR\} to comprise a series of sediment-draped flat plains (37.65% of area) with intervening gentle slopes ranging from 5° to 30° (56.70% of area) and slopes steeper than 30° (5.65% of area). The steep slopes have significant areas of hard substrate (70%) comprising bare cliff faces and rock outcrops. Within the local-scale approach, detailed surveys of such steep areas were done by multi-beam sonar and cameras mounted on a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). In several locations, the terrace-like seafloor topography has also been identified. Overall, it has been shown that the \{MAR\} lower bathyal is 95% covered with soft sediment. "

The multi-beam echo-sounder (MBES) system provides high-resolution bathymetry and backscatter information with 100% coverage. In this paper, we present a seafloor classification method that employs the \{MBES\} backscatter data. The method uses the averaged backscatter data per beam. It, therefore, is independent on the quality of the \{MBES\} calibration. Also, its performance is insensitive to seafloor type variation along the \{MBES\} swathe and corrections for the angular dependence of the backscatter are not needed. The method accounts for the ping-to-ping variability of the backscatter intensity. It estimates both the number of seafloor types present in the survey area and the probability density function for the backscatter strength at a certain angle for each of the seafloor types. Application of the method to \{MBES\} backscatter data acquired in a well-known test area in the North Sea shows very good agreement with available ground truth. The method’s discriminatory performance for this area is demonstrated to be comparable to that of taking samples of the sediment. All seafloor types known to be present in the area are resolved for. Application of the method to the Stanton bank data set shows clearly separable areas that differ in seafloor composition. "

We generate three-dimensional reconstructions over large spatial scales using data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), manned submersibles and diver-held imaging systems. We propose a new method for calculating rugosity in a Delaunay triangulated surface mesh by projecting areas onto the plane of best fit using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Slope and aspect can be calculated with very little extra effort, and fitting a plane serves to decouple rugosity from slope. We compare the results of the virtual terrain complexity calculations with experimental results using conventional <italic>in-situ</italic> measurement methods. We show that performing calculations over a digital terrain reconstruction is more flexible, robust and easily repeatable. In addition, the method is non-contact and provides much less environmental impact compared to traditional survey techniques. For diver-based surveys, the time underwater needed to collect rugosity data is significantly reduced and, being a technique based on images, it is possible to use robotic platforms that can operate beyond diver depths. Measurements can be calculated exhaustively at multiple scales for surveys with tens of thousands of images covering thousands of square metres. The technique is demonstrated on data gathered by a diver-rig and an AUV, on small single-transect surveys and on a larger, dense survey that covers over <inline-formula><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0050440.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Stereo images provide 3D structure as well as visual appearance, which could potentially feed into automated classification techniques. Our multi-scale rugosity, slope and aspect measures have already been adopted in a number of marine science studies.

Since robot navigation is most naturally represented in a continuous domain, the problem is cast as a continuous-state POMDP. Probability distributions over state space, or beliefs, are represented in parametric form using low-dimensional vectors of sufficient statistics. The belief space, over which the value function must be estimated, has dimensionality equal to the number of sufficient statistics. Compared to methods based on discretising the state space, this work trades the loss of the belief space’s convexity for a reduction in its dimensionality and an efficient closed-form solution for belief updates. Fitted value iteration is used to solve the POMDP. The approach is empirically compared to a discrete \{POMDP\} solution method on a simulated continuous navigation problem. We show that, for a suitable environment and parametric form, the proposed method is capable of scaling to large state-spaces. "

Operation in a planetary environment imposes sensing restrictions, as well as challenges due to the rugged terrain. Utilizing a laser rangefinder mounted on a rover platform, we have demonstrated an approach that is able to create globally consistent maps of natural, unstructured 3D terrain. The framework presented in this paper utilizes a sparse-feature-based approach and conducts data association using a combination of feature constellations and dense data. Because of feature scarcity, odometry measurements are also incorporated to provide additional information in feature-poor regions. To maintain global consistency, these measurements are resolved using a batch alignment algorithm, which is reinforced with heterogeneous outlier rejection to improve its robustness to outliers in either measurement type (i.e., laser or odometry). Finally, a map is created from the alignment estimates and the dense data. Extensive validation of the framework is provided using data gathered at two different planetary analogue facilities, which consist of 50 and 102 3D scans, respectively. At these sites, root-mean-squared mapping errors of 4.3 and 8.9 cm were achieved. Relative metrics are utilized for localization accuracy and map quality, which facilitate detailed analysis of the performance, including failure modes and possible future improvements. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
