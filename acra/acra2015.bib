    abstract = "Abstract For very large datasets with more than a few classes, producing ground-truth data can represent a substantial, and potentially expensive, human effort. This is particularly evident when the datasets have been collected for a particular purpose, e.g. scientific inquiry, or by autonomous agents in novel and inaccessible environments. In these situations there is scope for the use of unsupervised approaches that can model collections of images and automatically summarise their content. To this end, we present novel hierarchical Bayesian models for image clustering, image segment clustering, and unsupervised scene understanding. The purpose of this investigation is to highlight and compare hierarchical structures for modelling context within images based on visual data alone. We also compare the unsupervised models with state-of-the-art supervised and weakly supervised models for image understanding. We show that some of the unsupervised models are competitive with the supervised and weakly supervised models on standard datasets. Finally, we demonstrate these unsupervised models working on a large dataset containing more than one hundred thousand images of the sea floor collected by a robot. "}

    abstract = {This paper shows how existing methods of probabilistic least-squares classification based on Gaussian processes can be used to construct a probabilistic representation of a habitat map using data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A novel adaptive habitat classifying algorithm is presented, which uses a Monte Carlo simulation technique to select the most informative mission from a set of candidates. Approximations are presented to assign upper and lower bounds to the information expected from the candidate missions. This allows missions to be efficiently pruned from the set of candidates so that the algorithm converges to a preferred candidate with a reduced number of simulations. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated in an experiment carried out using an AUV at Jervis Bay, Australia. Â© 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
