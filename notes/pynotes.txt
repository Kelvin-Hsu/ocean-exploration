Topic: Sparse matrices - Diagonal matrices

If you have a diagonal matrix W and a normal matrix B and they have the same size, 
suppose w = W.diagonal()

then we have 

B.dot(W) == w * B == B * w

W.dot(B) == (w * B.T).T == (B.T * w).T

Using from scipy.sparse import dia_matrix, suppose Wsp = dia_matrix(W)

Then W.dot(B) == Wsp.dot(B), also this is the same as Wsp * B

HOWEVER, B.dot(W) != B.dot(Wsp)

Instead, use B * Wsp
