I have two local branches

kelvin
master

There are two remote branches I am interested in

Kelvin
master

Typical work process:

git pull origin master:master (to synchronise master)
git pull origin master:kelvin (to start working on my own local branch)

From here on I will work on my local kelvin branch
The local master branch is for me to have a local copy of the current remote master branch in case I need it (probably I don't)

After I'm done working, do

git push origin kelvin:Kelvin (to update my own remote branch)

Depending on the circumstances, either merge with master or push to master

git push origin kelvin:master
git push kelvin:master (update my own local master)

To merge...

git merge something (check up later)



Do the following to setup the current local branch to track the remote branch "Kelvin" 
git branch -u origin/Kelvin

PUSHING:

when different names
git push origin kelvin:Kelvin

to remove upstream
git branch --unset-upstream

git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/Kelvin LOCALKELVIN
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/Kelvin Kelvin

git reset --hard origin/Kelvin


rebase instead of merge if working separately

If my local master is a few commits ahead and I want it to match remote:
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
